                Hired on as the first Frontend focused developer for the
                engineering team. Engineering teams were struggling to build out
                a delightful, interactive web experience for customers while
                also keeping things maintainable and tested. Initial goals were
                to migrate away from SSR (Ruby Rails + HAML) to React, educate
                team on how to unit test frontend code, introduce TypeScript,
                improve tooling and infrastructure, improve developer enablement
                by creating a culture of learning and continuous improvement,
                and much more.
