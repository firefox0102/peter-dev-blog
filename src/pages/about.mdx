# About Me

Hello! My name is Peter Finn, and I am a software developer from Atlanta Georgia.

I am a positive thinking, self starting software developer who dreams in *JavaScript* and someday hopes to find that perfect balance of speed and quality. Although I am a technologist, I actually consider my greatest strengths to be communication and working with people! I may never be the smartest person in the room, but I will always have your back.

I have a passion for "Front-End" web development and single page apps, and love to explore new technologies that push the bleeding edge of what a web browser is capable of.

I also enjoy presenting at conferences, playing ping pong, and traveling around the world experiencing new cultures and making connections!

### A Bit of History

I graduated from *Southern Polytechnic State University* in 2014 with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Game Design and Development.

Although it was the thing that initially ignited my passion for technology, I quickly realized that the Video Game industry was not the right fit for me. Not knowing exactly what I wanted from my career, I worked at two different software companies as a full stack developer doing all manner of things and technologies; *Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, AngularJS*. 

After working with a few different technologies in my professional life, I came to the realization that JavaScript was **REALLY** fun to work with.

The rest, they say.... is history!
