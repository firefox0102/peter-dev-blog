# About Me

Hello! My name is Peter Finn, and I am a software developer from Atlanta Georgia.

I am a positive thinking, self starting software developer with a passion for all things Frontend. Although I am a technologist, I actually consider my greatest strengths to be communication and working with people! I may never be the smartest person in the room, but I will always have your back.

I also enjoy presenting at conferences, playing ping pong, and traveling around the world experiencing new cultures and making connections!
