Hindsight is a funny thing.

SalesLoft is a few years deep into a transition from AngularJS to React for our Frontend technology, and sometimes it can feel like we're been fighting a losing battle. I often think to myself in a panic, "WHY! WHY DID I DO THIS TO MYSELF! I built this, didn't I know that in three years this code would be my own undoing?"

However, instead of dwelling on the current state of things, I'd like to reflect on AngularJS and some of the lessons I learned using it. It wasn't a perfect tool by any means, but it paved the way for modern JavaScript development and at the same time made tons of mistakes that other frameworks thankfully learned from and avoided.

Things to talk about:

- Single Page Application Architecture

- Trying to do too much

  - AngularJS tried to be a one stop shop for everything, and this meant that it didn't really play nice with a lot of other non-angularjs specific libraries and tools
  - this is one reason why React was seen as a minimal alternative, although today it doesn't feel as lightweight as some of it's competitors.

- Two Way vs One Way data binding

  - Components reaching in to one another's state

- Separation of concerns

  - See my article titles "Don't Weld Your Frontend Technologies Together"

- Application state vs Local State

  - There really wasn't a difference in most AngularJS apps, local component state was your app state

- Templates vs JSX

- No Lazy Loading

#### The Death of AngularJS

Imagine you’re a medium sized business who’s just made it through a few years of painstaking growth, and you’ve finally managed to make it to a pretty comfortable place in your business. You’re no longer in danger of going bankrupt every week, and you can start to focus on quality a little more. This is exactly where SalesLoft found itself in January of 2018 when it was announced that AngularJS was being deprecated by Google. Overnight, our app went from decent quality with a few minor issues to approaching extinction.

The demise of AngularJS was such a shock for so many developers because it did EVERYTHING for you. It handled app state, control flow, data fetching, presentation. Our entire application was written in AngularJS and suddenly Google had just volunteered us for an entire app rewrite.

This is why I find separation of concerns so vital in frontend architecture. It’s so easy to just constantly focus on execution and speed of development, but you need to think long term about some of the things that could kill your business, or at the least cause all of your dev team to quit because they’re forced to work with “ancient” (see: 4 years old) technologies.

#### That's It For Now!

Obviously the list goes on and on, but the point is that there are many great lessons we can learn by comparing and contrasting AngularJS to newer technologies.

This post is pretty high level, but hopefully you've come away with some inspiration for how you can think about your own frontend code and how to protect yourself from a full re-write.

With the gift of hindsight and a little bit of knowledge about the history of the JavaScript ecosystem, we can understand our past mistakes and hopefully avoid making them all over again!
